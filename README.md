# **Techlerry Project**

Techlerry is a health monitoring and emergency alert system designed to track steps, heart rate, and trigger SOS alerts in case of emergencies. This repository contains the frontend code for the Techlerry app, built with React Native and Expo.

---

## **Features**
- **Step Counting:** Track daily steps using accelerometer data.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring:** Monitor heart rate and detect anomalies.
- **SOS Alerts:** Trigger emergency alerts manually or automatically based on abnormal heart rate or motion patterns.
- **Activity History:** View step count and heart rate trends over time.
- **Emergency Contacts:** Manage and notify emergency contacts during SOS events.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Backend:** Flask (for API endpoints)
- **Libraries:**
  - `react-navigation` for navigation
  - `react-native-svg-charts` or `victory-native` for data visualization
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` for data processing and visualization (Python backend)
  - `TensorFlow Lite` or `PyTorch Mobile` for lightweight AI models
